This assignment will focus on the implementation and visualization of Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis and Perceptron algorithms learnt in class on dataset_1, dataset_2 and dataset_3. The data sets are uploaded in CMS.

1. Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (as described in Bishop ch 4)
   Once the points are transformed to one dimension, visualize them as points on a line.
   Colour the points belonging to different classes with different colours.
   Determine the classification threshold by plotting normal curves for each class and finding their point of intersection.
   Libraries may be used only for data handling and visualization. The algorithm must be coded from scratch.

2. Perceptron
   Visualize the dataset as a scatterplot.
   Implement the perceptron algorithm and show the change in the decision boundary on the scatterplot with each epoch.
   Combine the plots into a GIF (You could use the ’images to GIF’ section of https://imgflip.com/gif-maker or giphy to convert plots into a GIF)
   Java, C++, C or Python may be used for this assignment.
   Submitted codes will be tested on standard plagiarism detection tools and those with plagiarism above a threshold will not be evaluated.

3. Report
   Prepare a formal report detailing your observations and results obtained.
   Discuss the difference between the datasets with respect to the perceptron convergence theorem and report the impact of parameter initialization and training data ordering on the models.

Note that the code must be properly indented and commented.
